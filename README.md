# Taxi-data-prediction-
This project focuses on predicting taxi fares using machine learning models. The fare of a taxi ride depends on several factors like pickup and drop-off locations and the number of passengers. The goal of this project was to build a model that can accurately estimate the fare based on available trip details.
